h1. Cloud UI Toolkit

h2. About

The Cloud UI tookit is an extensible, jQuery-based framework for
building rich UIs. Derived from the development of the user interface
for the [CloudStack](http://www.cloudstack.org) project, the Cloud UI
tookit is a collection of widgets and utilities for building
interfaces for handling large sets of data, with an emphasis on user
experience.

This library is still under development, and is a heavy refactor of
the existing widgets in the [current CloudStack UI codebase](https://github.com/CloudStack/CloudStack/tree/master/ui). Documentation and website still under progress.
